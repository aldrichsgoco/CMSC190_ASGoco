Abstract:
In this work, an artificial game player for the
Modified Stick Running was created using the NeuroEvolution
of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. NEAT was used to
evolve the neural network of the game agent to play the game
indefinitely. Game states are represented using three features
including the height and width of the nearest obstacle and
also its distance to the game agent. The fitness of the agent
is the combination of its score and traveled distance. After the
Algorithm was run for 30 generations with a maximum scoring
of 50 points, it has successfu
